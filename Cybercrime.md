# CyberCrime:
## The crimes committed online using computer and other physical devices and aim at looting the audience online comes under cybercrime.
### Let  me explain it through a case study: 
 A customer has seen an advertisement on instagram  where decent merches were on sale on reduced prices. Such stuff encourages audience to buy them . These sites claim to have affiliation 
 and support of large markets which is only false. These claim to follow a set of rules and exhibit all protection regarding your personal details.  These offer return policy. But once ordered, these sites are
 difficult to find and later customer gets to know that it was a cybercrime wherein a set of disposed clothes have been sent for a high price with no policy of complaint and no return available. Therefore it is very 
important to beware of such sites and keep awaring others of the same.

### Second example:
Many frauds takes place by stealing personal information and making indecent use of it. They may also blackmail the victim of leaking the private data if the given amount is not deposited.

To escape such tactics , one must be awake to know the reality and  go through a research before trusting such sites. Also complain it to cybercell as soon as crime is committed.
